# DC-2021-FRM-ReportService
A new initative for 2021 is inline report creation for Funding Rules Monitoring reports. The Funding Rules Monitoring are a suite of reports which look for data that might breach the funding rules. There is an existing process that currently generates the reports from data warehouse based data. Because of that data source there is much higher latency. This ILR submission process generates the reports earlier.
